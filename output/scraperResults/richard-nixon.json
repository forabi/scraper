He's the only president to have resigned after the Watergate scandal marred his reputation, disenchanting Americans for generations. In fact, some theorize that the Nixon administration is responsible for the decline in America's trust of politicians and the political process."

Following in the footsteps of a number of European countries, Nixon took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard, giving the U.S. Federal Reserve greater power–a move still controversial today. It managed to only temporarily boost the U.S. economy in 1971, just in time for reelection."
