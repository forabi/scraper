Martin, much like his college self, is still looking for answers. My interpretation is: Religion and its mythology is hard to take seriously for reasons of real-world credibility. But science has problems too, as it does not take into account anything beyond the physical world (metaphysics). Therefore, it seems a stretch to call Martin an atheist. He seems to feel that important \"stuff\" does exist beyond the physical world."
