He instead retreated to England and declared himself the leader of the Free French Forces, which joined the Allies in their eventual defeat of Germany. After presiding over France's interim post-war government, he resigned in 1946 to protest the constitution's lack of a strong executive power. Political instability plagued the country in de Gaulle's absence. He assumed emergency powers in 1958 while a new constitution was written, and spent the next ten years as president of France's new government."
