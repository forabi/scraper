They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way."

Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican… Okay. I admit it. I hate government and I hate political parties."
