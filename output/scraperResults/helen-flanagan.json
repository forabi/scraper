      "text": "Flanagan isn't known for her intelligence. Whether that's a fair characterization or not, it doesn't seem that she's done any serious thinking on either religion or politics. She definitely gets into the Christmas spirit, so a Christian, probably Anglican, background of some sort is highly likely–but her festivities probably revolve around shopping more than deep contemplation about the nativity of the baby Jesus."

It was from a photo shoot she had done previously, and she was trying to make a statement about how hung over she was. Not surprisingly, she didn't get a great reaction."
