But you sometimes feel the need for a slightly more formal service and perhaps a little bit more formality in the underlying theology too. So throughout my life I have felt the need for both things, to some extent for the informality, for the works you do; but always I found myself groping out for more of the actual teaching of the religious basis."

Between Thatcher in Britain and Reagan in the U.S., these two powerhouses oversaw an era of glorious capitalism throughout most of the 1980s. Thatcher was staunchly anti-socialist and her ascent to power included a mandate to reduce the role of government in the private sector of Britain in hopes of turningBritain's sluggish economy around."
