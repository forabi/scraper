Her husband, Louis XVI, was rather introverted and often avoided the more pressing political concerns that landed at his doorstep. And when the French Revolution broke out in 1789, it was Antoinette that gathered her advisors, made decisions and sent letters to other European monarchs asking for assistance."

Who do you think will be the next Marie Antoinette?"
