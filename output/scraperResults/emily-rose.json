In January 2013, to announce the impending birth of their first child, Rose and her husband created a mock-movie trailer with images from some ultrasounds. The credits at the end of the short  show their belief that God had a hand in the creation of their little one. The credits show that the film is presented by \"God and Unexpected Pictures,\" the production company is listed as \"The Big Man Upstairs,\" casting is by \"God's Sense of Humor,\" and it is directed by \"The Big Man Upstairs.\""
