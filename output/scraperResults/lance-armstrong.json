Although both seemed relaxed and without expectations, they claimed that Armstrong was in better shape for this time of year than in a normal year due to a longer preparation for the season, this time starting in July rather than the usual December. He said that he still had some weight to lose and as a result he estimated that his current time-trial form would be better than climbing. The impression was that he had no great expectations for the Tour Down Under but stated that if opportunities arose that he would take them.</p>",
