And no matter how strongly he felt about Newtown, he didn't start talking about gun control."

This came on the heels of an incident he had when he was picking up his daughter from school. He says police profiled him because of his tattoos, then accused him of having guns and drugs in the car. He didn't."

That's all I've got, though, so give me a break.Â If you can help me out at all with some good information on Barker's political beliefs, I'd be much obliged. Thanks readers!"
