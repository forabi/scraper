Garfield lay dying for months after being shot by an assassin in 1881, Bell speculated that there must be a way for doctors to locate where the bullets were in his body so as to remove them and save the president's life. Though it didn't pan out in time, and Garfield died of his wounds, it was the spark that caused Bell to invent the metal detector."
