Other date stamps and notations refer to the photograph’s subsequent use by the newspaper, including another article attached, dated January 26, 1947 upon Capone’s death. Capone earned the nickname \"Scarface\" from a bar brawl when he was 18 years old, working as a bartender and bouncer for gangster Frankie Vale. Capone went on to become one of the most ruthless gang leaders ever, whose Chicago operations were routinely disrupted by famous federal agent Eliot Ness (The Untouchables).
