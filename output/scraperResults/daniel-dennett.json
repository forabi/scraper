For example, Marxists feel that a revolution of the working class will come eventually, so they attempt to create the social conditions that would encourage such a revolution. On the other end, religious fanatics believe in some sort of \"End Days\" or Armageddon, so they attempt to create the political or social conditions conducive to this Armageddon. Dennett finds these people dangerous and probably unstable."
