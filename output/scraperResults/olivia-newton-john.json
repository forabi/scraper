Maybe O-N-J and her agent know something we don't.</p>\n<p>Twilight Eclipse hunk Xavier Samuel stars as the film's hapless bridegroom.</p>\n<p>British thespians Kris Marshall (Death At A Funeral) Kevin Bishop (Spanish Apartment), and Australian comedy star Rebel Wilson was there, as was Laura Brent (Chronicles of Narnia), Steve Le Marquand (Beneath Hill 60) and Tangle actor Tim Draxl. Even local MP Malcolm Turnbull and wife Lucy showed up in support.</p>\n<p>The flick, which was filmed in Sydney and the Blue Mountains, is hoped to be a return to form for Elliott, who has had mixed success since his 1994 smash hit The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert.</p>\n<p>It's quite an unlikely acting platform for Newton-John, who many film industry commentators say her last decent film role was alongside John Travolta in Two of a Kind back in 1983.</p>\n<p>Elliott told the media that the Aussie singer/actress has fitted in well with the rest of the cast.</p>\n<p>\"She's great. Everyone's coming together really well and she's really getting into it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>A Few Best Men opens in cinemas nationally on January 26, 2012.</p>\n<p>Director: Stephan Elliott Writers: Dean Craig Stars: Rebel Wilson, Olivia Newton-John and Xavier Samuel</p>\n<p>Websites</p>\n<p>A Few Best Men official website <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.afewbestmenthemovie.com\">www.afewbestmenthemovie.com</a></p>\n<p>Icon Film Distribution <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.iconmovies.com.au\">www.iconmovies.com.au</a></p>\n<p>Event Cinemas <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.eventcinemas.com.au\">www.eventcinemas.com.au</a></p>\n<p>Nix Co <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nixco.com.au\">www.nixco.com.au</a></p>\n<p>Eva Rinaldi Photography Flickr <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography\">www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography</a></p>\n<p>Eva Rinaldi Photography <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.evarinaldi.com\">www.evarinaldi.com</a></p>\n<p>Splash News <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.splashnews.com\">www.splashnews.com</a></p>\n<p>Music News Australia <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.musicnewsaustralia.com\">www.musicnewsaustralia.com</a></p>",
