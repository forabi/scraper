She has never donated to a single Republican, though almost half of her donations have gone to special interest groups or politically-independent organizations. Some of the more recognizable candidates that have received money from Sarandon include former California governor Jerry Brown's failed bid for president, Hillary Clinton (both Senate and presidential campaigns), screaming Howard Dean, now-disgraced John Edwards, Ralph Nader and, of course, Obama."
