He was at least aware that the 2012 presidential election was happening, even though he didn't officially endorse a candidate. He posted a video on his twitter account of several famous skaters asking the candidates their views on various skateboarding issues spliced in with footage from the debates, making it look like they were actually answering. The video's goal didn't seem to be a political endorsement, but I think Obama came out on top."
