One could imagine that the Judeo-Christian concepts of modesty and sexual prudity don't go over very well with those in the porn industry. But it doesn't seem like she's particularly against God either. She just doesn't have a thing to say. So really. . . neither do I. Shall we move on?"

She thinks freedom of choice on the internet could end up destroying business and in turn jobs and paychecks. But she stopped short of saying the government should get involved. Instead she feels like the industry just has to evolve and figure out how to make it in the new market."
