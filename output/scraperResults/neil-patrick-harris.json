The video, which featured Jack Black as Jesus and Neil Patrick Harris as himself, pointed out various inconsistencies in Christian anti-gay logic. For example, while Christians might cite the Bible, which says gays are an \"abomination,\" they might eat shellfish, which is also an \"abomination\" in the Bible. Or if the Bible's position on gays must be taken literally, then why not other edicts, like stoning one's insolent wife to death?"
