But it was as a Playmate of the Year representative for Playboy magazine, and was more about her ability to perform a provocative dance in a Santa suit than it was about celebrating the birth of Jesus."

Maybe she's a Libertarian because she doesn't believe government should be able to regulate adult content in magazines or online. Or maybe she is a Republican because she doesn't want to pay high taxes on her $1.5 million income."
