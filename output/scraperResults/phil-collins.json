This came as certain wealthy Brits were threatening to leave Britain in 1992 if the Labour Party, with its high tax rates for the rich, were to win the elections. Collins was counted among them, and later admitted that he certainly did not want most of his income taken, but that it didn't mean he was a Tory. However, he said that from his home in the tax haven country of Switzerland."
