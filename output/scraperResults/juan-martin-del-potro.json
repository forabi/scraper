Considering his strong support of both Catholicism and the Catholic hierarchy, I could guess that he's socially conservative: opposed to abortion rights, gay rights, and possibly even contraception. But then again, his girlfriend hasn't gotten pregnant yet (I couldn't quite figure out if they're still dating), so maybe he does believe in birth control after all. (Oh, settle down, it was only a joke.)"
