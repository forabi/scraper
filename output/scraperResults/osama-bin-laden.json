They say that our sharia does not impose our particular beliefs upon others; this is a false assertion. For it is, in fact, part of our religion to impose our particular beliefs upon others. Thus whoever refuses the principle of terror[ism] against the enemy also refuses the commandment of Allah the Exalted, the Most High, and His sharia."

Killing people is certainly a bad way to convert them–unless you want to kill all of the unbelievers, which would amount to billions of people, and that's a tall order. Perhaps these converts would become fundamentalist, Sharia-loving Muslims through fear–but that's not much of a conversion, is it?"
