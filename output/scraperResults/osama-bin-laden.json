Not laws under the \"umbrella of justice, morality, and rights\" as understood by the masses. No, the sharia of Islam is the foundation. They say that our sharia does not impose our particular beliefs upon others; this is a false assertion. For it is, in fact, part of our religion to impose our particular beliefs upon others. Thus whoever refuses the principle of terror[ism] against the enemy also refuses the commandment of Allah the Exalted, the Most High, and His sharia."

However, one must question if Osama and his peers have really thought this through. Killing people is certainly a bad way to convert them–unless you want to kill all of the unbelievers, which would amount to billions of people, and that's a tall order. Perhaps these converts would become fundamentalist, Sharia-loving Muslims through fear–but that's not much of a conversion, is it?"
