You can tell by his lyrics that Jeezy is informed about politics. But he probably hasn't seen a lot of help from the government in his life–especially early on–and has another reality that has nothing to do with whether or not gay people can get married or the children of immigrants can get student loans. But having a black man in the White House–that's something he can get behind."
