From the several translations I did find, it doesn't seem like he has converted to Islam as many suggest. Rather, he says that he feels closer to Islam than any other religion, that he respects his Muslim friends, and that if he were to convert to a religion, it would be Islam."

Coming from a family of immigrants however, it wouldn't be a surprise if Henry didn't think too highly of the president's politics, and particularly his stance on immigration."
