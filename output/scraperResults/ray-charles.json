Much of this conception comes from the fact that Charles refused to play clubs that practiced racial segregation–most notably in the state of his birth, Georgia, which subsequently \"banned him for life.\" However, Georgia issued an official apology to Charles in 1977 and made his song, \"Georgia on My Mind\" the official state song."

      "text": "But Charles sometimes chose money over principle when it came to racism. For example, he toured Apartheid South Africa in 1981, when most of the western world and the United Nations were in the midst of condemning and boycotting the country for its state-sponsored racism. When the UN asked Charles for an apology, he told them to \"kiss the far end.\" (That means his ass.)"
