At the age of eight, Freddie attended boarding school in Bombay, India–which was also a part of the British Empire at the time. At 17, Mercury's family fled Zanzibar as a result of a violent revolution and lived the rest of their days in England. Mercury died of AIDS in 1991 in Kensington, England."
