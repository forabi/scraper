  "religion": "Kaku was brought up by first generation Japanese immigrants in the United States. Some eastern philosophical religious principles surely influenced his upbringing. As a scientist and thinker, Kaku seems to feel that the universe, in its order and symmetry, is God. He is a pantheist",
  "politicalViews": "Most of Kaku's political views revolve around science, its misuse by governments and societies, and critique for funding dead-end agencies. He does, however, envision a utopian future where science has made a better life for all. His acknowledgement of science, especially in terms of global warming, put him in the liberal camp.",

For example, one of the most important revelations in Einstein's early childhood took place when he read his first books on science.

Throughout his career, however, he clung to the belief that a mysterious, divine Order existed in the universe."
