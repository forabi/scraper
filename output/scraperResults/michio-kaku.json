  "religion": "Kaku was brought up by first generation Japanese immigrants in the United States. Some eastern philosophical religious principles surely influenced his upbringing. As a scientist and thinker, Kaku seems to feel that the universe, in its order and symmetry, is God. He is a pantheist",
  "politicalViews": "Most of Kaku's political views revolve around science, its misuse by governments and societies, and critique for funding dead-end agencies. He does, however, envision a utopian future where science has made a better life for all. His acknowledgement of science, especially in terms of global warming, put him in the liberal camp.",

Throughout his career, however, he clung to the belief that a mysterious, divine Order existed in the universe.",
