  "religion": "Kaku was brought up by first generation Japanese immigrants in the United States. Some eastern philosophical religious principles surely influenced his upbringing. As a scientist and thinker, Kaku seems to feel that the universe, in its order and symmetry, is God. He is a pantheist",
  "politicalViews": "Most of Kaku's political views revolve around science, its misuse by governments and societies, and critique for funding dead-end agencies. He does, however, envision a utopian future where science has made a better life for all. His acknowledgement of science, especially in terms of global warming, put him in the liberal camp.",

      "text": "When scientists use the word God, they usually mean the God of Order. For example, one of the most important revelations in Einstein's early childhood took place when he read his first books on science. He immediately realized that most of what he had been taught about religion could not possibly be true. Throughout his career, however, he clung to the belief that a mysterious, divine Order existed in the universe."
