They're very proud that they're secular Turks… My father's family, a much more traditional family… religion was their core essence. It defined who they were, it's what gave them their morality. They would never feel comfortable separating away their view toward the law from their view toward their religion."

This small, mostly unknown sect of Protestantism is based around the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, who was known for his God-inspired trances (similar to the whirling, spinning trances advocated by the Sufi Muslims) and his out-of-body experiences during which Swedenborg claims to have visited various planets in the solar system."
