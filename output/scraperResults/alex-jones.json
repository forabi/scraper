He's said a lot of things and I'm really only familiar enough to offer this skeleton of an idea of his overall philosophy. But if I was to offer one critique, it would be that of the hour or so of Alex Jones that I listened to today, most of it I couldn't understand. He makes countless esoteric references, he talks about things that require quite a bit of contextual knowledge, and at times, yes, he seems totally insane."
