I grew up in a really cool area of the country where tolerance was kind of the norm. I can't recall at any point in my life ever feeling uncomfortable about sexuality whether it be my own or anyone else's. . . . It's an interesting time to be a homosexual in this country. I hope that very soon we get to this point where we look back now, [like] on women's rights and that struggle in the 20s–I hope this is another hurdle this country can overcome really quick. (("
